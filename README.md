##Issues##
I spent a long time trying to dicipher the response from the Spotify API. I asked the TAs for help and was able to go farther with the data. My individual functions are working propertly, but I can't seem to line them up to be performed in sequence with the user input. This assignment was super tough for me. I was not able to add all the required components of the application, such as the "do-what-it-says" funciton. I was not able to append a text file with user input. I was not able to get more than one artist from the Spotify API. I basically have some psuedo and started code, but my app in not functioning as intended.
