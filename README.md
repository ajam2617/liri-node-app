##Issues##
I spent a long time trying to dicipher the response from the Spotify API. I asked the TAs for help and was able to go farther with the data. This assignment was super challenging for me. I was not able to have the function "do-what-it-says". I was not able to append a text file with user input. I was not able to get more than one artist from the Spotify API.
